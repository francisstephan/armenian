# Greek breathings, accents and iota subscript
Special characters are used for rough breathing (rho and vowels)

Smooth breathing is obtained by adding the character q ==after== the vowel.

Accents are obtained by adding one character to the vowel: 
- é for acute : aé ==> ά
- è for grave : uè ==> ὺ
- â for circumflex : ôâ ==> &#1FF6;

iota subscript is obtained by adding the character ç after the vowel. Example : aç ==> α̨

Works well to copy in browsers and text editors, not so well in MS Word. I'm currently working on it.
